I am curious to see what my little brother Kenai has been doing lately.  It seems he developed a tool [@arnholt_third_2002] that is more sophisticated than my gerber knife shown below. ![mygerber](mygerber.jpg)  Kenai did some great fantastic facial reconstruction [@lopez_safety_2007] while he was in theater.  Keep up the good work little brother.
